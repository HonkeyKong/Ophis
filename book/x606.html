>      Conveniently creating runnable NES programs is somewhat
      involved. Any given product was generally burned onto several
      chips that were affixed to one of a large number of circuit
      boards. These are often referred to as "mappers" by
      developers because their effect is to implement various
      bankswitching schemes. The result is a program built out of
      parts, each with its own origin. A "Hello World"
      sample program ships with Ophis. It does not use a bankswitcher,
      but it does split its contents into a program chip and a
      graphics chip, with one of two wrapper files to knit them
      together into a file that other software will recognize. Samples
      are given for the common iNES format and the defunct UNIF
      format.
